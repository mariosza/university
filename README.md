  2. *Resources*

      For this course and for any linear algebra course I recommend the video lectures by Professor Gilbert Strang for MIT 18.06 ([Video Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/18-06SCF11)).
      For exam preparation, as with any other math course, I would recommend that you try to solve past papers and assignments on your own and look at solutions when you get stuck ðŸ˜•.
