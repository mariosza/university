  2. Resources
      For this course and for any linear algebra course I recommend the video lectures by Professor Gilbert Strang for MIT 18.06 ([Here](https://ocw.mit.edu/18-06SCF11)).
      Preparing for exams: As with other mathematic courses, I highly recommend that you try to solve problems like past exams and assignments on your own and look at the solutions when you get stuck.
